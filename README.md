  rails db:create

* Assumptions 

  Made a search form for actors and I assumed that it means search movies of certain actor.
  No user auth system 
  Because haven't user/actor/director email so identified them based in thier name. If user name repeated I considered it the existing user same for actor and director. 
  Erd diagram is there on root path please check that as well.
